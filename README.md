# 3D-Printer
Message for alex: I know that the project is poorly logged but that's because I've mostly worked on the printer while I was at school, and when I got home I always forgot to log my hours, I've a very bed memory so please understand :) 
## Goals
- The printer should be simple and good looking, something that you can put in your bedroom without it ruining the design of  your room
- It should have a mechanism to remove the print from the bed
- It should be self-leveling (i'm a lazy guy)
- it's as cheap as possible
  ## Plan
  I don't know, i'm completely lost but i wont use chatGPT for this project!!

# Update 
I decided to change my plan, I want to make as many parts as possible out of wood, and then cover everything with balck paint and a heat resistant resin. 

There are already some 3d printers made of wood but the problem with them is that they're not good looking, and I want to fix that!
