# 3D-Printer
## Goals
- The printer should be simple and good looking, something that you can put in your bedroom without it ruining the design of  your room
- It should have a mechanism to remove the print from the bed
- It should be self-leveling (i'm a lazy guy)
- it's as cheap as possible
  ## Plan
  I don't know, i'm completely lost but i wont use chatGPT for this project!!
