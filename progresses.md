# Progresses
## Feb 9

So i finished watching this video, and i think that I'm ready for the cad part, I still have to choose the size of the printer, but i think that it'll be around the same as an Ender 3. as soon as i can i'll start doing some research for parts like the printing bed, the stepper motors and the touchscreen display to start planning the BOM

Research: 30m

## March 5

Today I continued the BOM by adding the pulley and the timing belt, I also continued a bit the CAD design by adding some parts for the printhead motion, I still have to find the right linear actuator for the printing bed and I'm planning to take it from an open source printer like the Voron

CAD: 45m
Research 45m

## March 6

Soooo,  today I continued the CAD by adding the aluminium profile and the supports for it, I also found a cheap linear actuator for the Z axis, so as soon as I finish with the printhead, i should be ready for the buildplate, i'm thinking to use the ender 3 plate but i'm still looking for a cheaper option

Cad and researching: 1h
